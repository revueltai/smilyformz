## Game todos:

---

## Metagame todos:

- add language switch for UI and translations

## Ideas:

- add new expressions
- animate expression svgs

- make the character like Mario after a star... take any color or shape for say 5sec.

  - add a timer component to the game UI that counts down from 5 to 0
  - change character shape color, make it use the gradient while in "star" mode.

- add "Achievements" list, but create cool ones that actually give some small weird reward and not just a badge.

- add "challenges" or "game modes":
  - play a game with a specific shape only
  - play a game with a specific color only
  - play a game without matching power-ups
  - remain the same color for X seconds
  - remain the same shape for X seconds
  - reach X points without changing the shape
  - reach X points without changing the color
